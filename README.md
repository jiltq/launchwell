# Launchwell
A custom command-line launcher for indie sci-fi game Voices of the Void. Kinda scuffed right now, but *hella fast*.

I was inspired to create Launchwell after seeing [VoidLauncher](https://github.com/Tameranian/VoidLauncher), another custom launcher. However, it's written in python, has a "meh" gui and hasn't been updated in 7 months. I like speedy, tiny, portable programs - Launchwell is just that.
